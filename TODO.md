# bidicalc todo list

Test coverage improvements:
    processUserInput test: improve coverage
    test resolve functions
    cspsolver test: add expected iterations
    main solver testing: add expect solve in fewer than N splits

how bidicalc works blog post / doc

Improve solver, in particular solution found for a*b, a*b*c, etc.

support # prefix syntax in formula cells: block upstream updating

move solver to a web worker thread

user selection of renderNumber precision

refactor common code between tfmodel and nsfmodel

hide error tooltip when cell has focus, but show formula tooltip when cell has focus

highlight dependencies and dependents on focus

support domain for variables, for example ~[1, 10] interval syntax?
positive or negative domain syntax for vars: >0 <0, etc.
